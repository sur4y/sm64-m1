# Super Mario 64 Port

### NOTE: Please download the source code from the latest release, not by downloading the .zip of the code directly as I have not yet figured out why my setup is working despite having made the same changes to the repo I forked this from.

Read the wiki for build instructions: https://github.com/Zoltar007/target_osx/wiki

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), and (E) with minor exceptions in the audio subsystem.
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures are in progress.
- Efforts to decompile the Shindou ROM steadily advance toward a matching build.
- Beyond Nintendo 64, it can also target Linux and Windows natively.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets.

## Building native executables

### Linux

1. Install prerequisites (Ubuntu): `sudo apt install -y git build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libsdl2-dev`.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`.
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the project folder for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
4. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
5. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e`.

### Windows

1. Install and update MSYS2, following all the directions listed on https://www.msys2.org/.
2. From the start menu, launch MSYS2 MinGW and install required packages depending on your machine (do **NOT** launch "MSYS2 MSYS"):
  * 64-bit: Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`
  * 32-bit (will also work on 64-bit machines): Launch "MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" and install: `pacman -S git make python3 mingw-w64-i686-gcc`
  * Do **NOT** by mistake install the package called simply `gcc`.
3. The MSYS2 terminal has a _current working directory_ that initially is `C:\msys64\home\<username>` (home directory). At the prompt, you will see the current working directory in yellow. `~` is an alias for the home directory. You can change the current working directory to `My Documents` by entering `cd /c/Users/<username>/Documents`.
4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port.git`, which will create a directory `sm64-port` and then **enter** it `cd sm64-port`.
5. Place a *Super Mario 64* ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the project folder for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
6. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).
7. The executable binary will be located at `build/<VERSION>_pc/sm64.<VERSION>.f3dex2e.exe` inside the project directory.

#### Troubleshooting

1. If you get `make: gcc: command not found` although the packages did successfully install, you probably launched the wrong MSYS2. Read the instructions again. The terminal prompt should contain "MINGW32" or "MINGW64" in purple text, and **NOT** "MSYS".
2. If you get `Failed to open baserom.us.z64!` you failed to place the baserom in the project folder. You can write `ls` to list the files in the current working directory. If you are in the `sm64-port` directory, make sure you see it here.
3. If you get `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.`, you are not in the correct directory. Make sure the yellow text in the terminal ends with `sm64-port`. Use `cd <dir>` to enter the correct directory. If you write `ls` you should see all the project files, including `Makefile` if everything is correct.
4. If you get any error, be sure MSYS2 packages are up to date by executing `pacman -Syu` and `pacman -Su`.
5. When you execute `gcc -v`, be sure you see `Target: i686-w64-mingw32` or `Target: x86_64-w64-mingw32`. If you see `Target: x86_64-pc-msys`, you either opened the wrong MSYS start menu entry or installed the incorrect gcc package.

### Debugging

The code can be debugged using `gdb`. On Linux install the `gdb` package and execute `gdb <executable>`. On MSYS2 install by executing `pacman -S winpty gdb` and execute `winpty gdb <executable>`. The `winpty` program makes sure the keyboard works correctly in the terminal. Also consider changing the `-mwindows` compile flag to `-mconsole` to be able to see stdout/stderr as well as be able to press Ctrl+C to interrupt the program. In the Makefile, make sure you compile the sources using `-g` rather than `-O2` to include debugging symbols. See any online tutorial for how to use gdb.

## Quick Start ROM building (for Ubuntu)

1. Install prerequisites: `sudo apt install -y build-essential git binutils-mips-linux-gnu python3`.
2. Clone the repo from within Linux: `git clone https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64.git`.
3. Place a Super Mario 64 ROM called `baserom.<VERSION>.z64` into the project folder for asset extraction, where `VERSION` can be `us`, `jp`, or `eu`.
4. Run `make` to build. Qualify the version through `make TARGET_N64=1 VERSION=<VERSION>`. Add `-j4` to improve build speed (hardware dependent based on the amount of CPU cores available).

Ensure the repo path length does not exceed 255 characters. Long path names result in build errors.

## Installation for ROM building

### Windows

Install WSL and a distro of your choice following
[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
We recommend either Debian or Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distributions under WSL.
Note: WSL1 does not currently support Ubuntu 20.04.

Next, clone the SM64 repo from within the Linux shell:
`git clone https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64.git`

Then continue following the directions in the [Linux](#linux) installation section below.

### Linux

There are 3 steps to set up a working build.

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

The build system has the following package requirements:
 * ``binutils-mips``
 * ``python3 >= 3.6``
 * ``qemu-irix`` (When building without GCC)

Dependency installation instructions for common Linux distros are provided below:

##### Debian / Ubuntu
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential git binutils-mips-linux-gnu python3
```

Download latest package from [qemu-irix Releases.](https://github.com/n64decomp/qemu-irix/releases)

Install this package with:
```
sudo dpkg -i qemu-irix-2.11.0-2169-g32ab296eef_amd64.deb
```

##### Arch Linux
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel python
```
Install the following AUR packages:
* [mips64-elf-binutils](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mips64-elf-binutils) (AUR)
* [qemu-irix-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qemu-irix-git) (AUR)


##### Other Linux distributions

Most modern Linux distributions should have equivalent packages to the other two listed above.
You may have to use a different version of GNU binutils. Listed below are fully compatible binutils
distributions with support in the makefile, and examples of distros that offer them:

* `mips64-elf-` (Arch AUR)
* `mips-linux-gnu-` (Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros)
* `mips64-linux-gnu-` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora)

You may also use [Docker](#docker-installation) to handle installing an image with minimal dependencies.

#### Step 2: Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction

For each version (jp/us/eu) for which you want to build a ROM, put an existing ROM at
`./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.

##### Step 3: Build the ROM

Run `make` to build the ROM (defaults to `VERSION=us`).
Other examples:
```
make VERSION=jp -j4       # build (J) version instead with 4 jobs
make VERSION=eu COMPARE=0 # build (EU) version but do not compare ROM hashes
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.

The full list of configurable variables are listed below, with the default being the first listed:

* ``VERSION``: ``us``, ``jp``, ``eu``, ``sh`` (WIP)
* ``GRUCODE``: ``f3d_old``, ``f3d_new``, ``f3dex``, ``f3dex2``, ``f3dzex``
* ``COMPARE``: ``1`` (compare ROM hash), ``0`` (do not compare ROM hash)
* ``NON_MATCHING``: Use functionally equivalent C implementations for non-matchings. Also will avoid instances of undefined behavior.
* ``CROSS``: Cross-compiler tool prefix (Example: ``mips64-elf-``).
* ``QEMU_IRIX``: Path to a ``qemu-irix`` binary.
* ``TARGET_N64``: ``0`` If set to one, will build an N64 ROM. An unmodified repository will produce one of the following ROMs depending on what ``VERSION`` is set to:

  * sm64.jp.z64 `sha1: 8a20a5c83d6ceb0f0506cfc9fa20d8f438cafe51`
  * sm64.us.z64 `sha1: 9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce`
  * sm64.eu.z64 `sha1: 4ac5721683d0e0b6bbb561b58a71740845dceea9`


### macOS

Installing Docker is the recommended avenue for macOS users. This project does not support macOS natively due to lack of macOS host support.

### Docker Installation

#### Create Docker image

Create the docker image with `docker build -t sm64`.

#### Build

To build, mount the local filesystem into the Docker container and build the ROM with `docker run`.

##### macOS example for (U):
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

##### Linux example for (U):
For a Linux host, Docker needs to be instructed which user should own the output files:
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 --user $UID:$UID sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.
